# Mini-Project: Advanced Blog API

# In today's digital age, online blogging has become an integral part of our lives. Blogging platforms have revolutionized the way we share ideas, offering convenience, variety, and accessibility like never before. However, building a robust blogging application from scratch can be a complex task, involving various components such as user management, post creation, and comment handling.

# Imagine you are tasked with creating a blogging application that empowers both users and administrators. The goal is to build a user-friendly platform where users can effortlessly create posts, add comments, and engage with content. Simultaneously, administrators should have tools to manage users, moderate posts, and ensure a seamless blogging experience.

# To tackle this challenge, we will leverage the power of Python and two essential libraries: Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy. Flask is a lightweight web framework that simplifies web application development, while Flask-SQLAlchemy provides a robust toolkit for database interactions. Together, they form the perfect duo to craft our blogging solution.

# To guarantee the scalability of our API, we will empower it by modularizing the code and adding cache and rate limit services to control the performance of our API. Additionally, we will guarantee the correct functioning of our endpoints by performing the necessary tests to ensure that the logic is working correctly.

# In this project, we will guide you through the process of building a blogging application that closely mimics real-world scenarios.

# Project Requirements

# ðŸ’¡ Note: We've already developed key functionalities for our blogging project this week, including models, schemas, and endpoints for Users and Posts. To save time and maintain consistency, consider reusing the Flask-SQLAlchemy project as a foundation for Comments and User Management components. This approach ensures a unified and efficient codebase, making it easier to integrate new features into the existing solution.

# Users: Create the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for managing Users:
# - Create User: Implement an endpoint to add a new user to the database. Ensure that you capture essential user information, including name, email, unique username, and a secure password.
# - Read User: Develop an endpoint to retrieve user details based on their unique identifier (ID). Provide functionality to query and display user information.
# - Update User: Create an endpoint for updating user details, allowing modifications to the user's name, email, and other profile information.
# - Delete User: Implement an endpoint to delete a user from the system based on their ID.

# Posts: Create the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for managing Posts:
# - Create Post: Implement an endpoint to add a new post to the blog database. Capture essential post details, such as title, content, and author ID.
# - Read Post: Develop an endpoint to retrieve post details based on the post's unique identifier (ID). Provide functionality to query and display post information.
# - Update Post: Create an endpoint for updating post details, allowing modifications to the post title and content.
# - Delete Post: Implement an endpoint to delete a post from the system based on its unique ID.
# - List Posts: Develop an endpoint to list all available posts on the blogging platform. Ensure that the list provides essential post information.

# Comments: Create the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for managing Comments:
# - Create Comment: Implement an endpoint for users to add comments to a post. Capture essential comment details, such as content and author ID.
# - Read Comment: Develop an endpoint to retrieve comment details based on the comment's unique identifier (ID). Provide functionality to query and display comment information.
# - Update Comment: Create an endpoint for updating comment details, allowing modifications to the comment content.
# - Delete Comment: Implement an endpoint to delete a comment from the system based on its unique ID.
# - List Comments: Develop an endpoint to list all comments on a specific post. Ensure that the list provides essential comment information.

# Database Integration:
# - Utilize Flask-SQLAlchemy to integrate a MySQL database into the application.
# - Design and create the necessary Model to represent users, posts, comments, and any additional features.
# - Establish relationships between tables to model the application's core functionality.
# - Ensure proper database connections and interactions for data storage and retrieval.

# Modularization code:
# - The code must be modularized using a layered architecture. The organization of the project must be composed as follows: Controllers, Models, Routes, Services, Utils, Test.
# - The code must have a configuration file to configure all database connections, cache, etc.

# Performance improvement with cache and limit implementation:
# - Use the cache logic only to get requests using the flask-caching library.
# - Use flask-limiter to limit request consumption to 100 per day for all endpoints generated.

# Implement JWT Security:
# - Use the jwt library and implement a token that has a time limit of 1 hour. Additionally, all endpoints except login should require the JWT.
# - User and UserAccount endpoints must have the administrator role to be consumed.

# Unit test implementation with unittest:
# - Implement at least 1 test for each endpoint created. Use the unittest and mock library to be able to consider multiple scenarios.
# - Only implement tests at the service layer.
# - Implementing integration tests from the driver layer using pytest (bonus).

# Document API with Swagger library:
# - Use the Swagger library to be able to generate project documentation.
# - Generate the swagger.yaml file with the documentation of each of the generated endpoints.
# - The Swagger documentation must have the security implementation by jwt.

# GitHub Repository:
# - Create a GitHub repository for the project and commit code regularly.
# - Maintain a clean and interactive README.md file in the GitHub repository, providing clear instructions on how to run the application and explanations of its features.
# - Include a link to the GitHub repository in the project documentation.


# Submission
# - Upon completing the project, submit your code and video, including all source code files, and the README.md file in your GitHub repository to your instructor or designated platform.

# Project tips

# Python Programming:

# - Utilize a code generator like Flask-RESTful to simplify endpoint creation and API documentation simultaneously.
# - Implement data validation using libraries like Marshmallow to ensure input data meets certain criteria.
# - Use Flask's recommended folder structure to organize models, views, and controllers clearly and legibly.

# Database Integration:

# - Use Flask-SQLAlchemy to define database models and establish relationships between them.
# - Implement pagination in database queries to enhance performance and prevent server overload.
# - Design and create necessary models to represent users, posts, comments, and any additional features.

# Modularization code:

# - Break down the code into smaller, manageable modules following a layered architecture.
# - Use meaningful names for modules, classes, and functions to enhance readability and maintainability.
# - Consider employing Python's built-in logging module for effective error handling and debugging.

# Performance improvement with cache and limit implementation:

# - Utilize Flask-Caching for caching GET requests to improve performance.
# - Implement rate limiting with Flask-Limiter to control request consumption and prevent abuse.

# Implement JWT Security:

# - Use the jwt library to handle JWT token generation, validation, and authentication.
# - Secure endpoints requiring authentication by verifying JWT tokens and extracting user information from them.

# Unit test implementation with unittest:

# - Write concise and focused unit tests for each endpoint and functionality.
# - Utilize the unittest and mock libraries to isolate components for testing and simulate different scenarios.

# Document API with Swagger library:

# - Employ Flask-Swagger to generate comprehensive API documentation automatically.
# - Ensure that API documentation is kept up-to-date with changes to endpoints and functionalities.
# - Include information on authentication requirements, request parameters, and response formats in the documentation.

# GitHub Repository:

# - Commit code regularly to the GitHub repository to track changes and facilitate collaboration.
# - Follow best practices for version control, such as branching and merging, to manage code changes effectively.
