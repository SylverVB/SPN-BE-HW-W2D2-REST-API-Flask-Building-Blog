# Mini-Project: Blog API CI/CD

# The blog project, developed in previously, requires a streamlined Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for optimal performance. This pipeline should automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application to Render, a cloud platform. Key components include setting up a robust CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions, configuring a PostgreSQL database hosted on Render for the Flask API, and implementing unit tests using unittest for application reliability. The project will emphasize documentation and knowledge sharing to ensure efficient collaboration and project management. üõ†Ô∏èüîßüöÄüåü

# Project requirements

# 1. Utilize the blog project generated in Module 13 (previously):
# - Use the blog project created in Module 13 as the basis for this CI/CD project.

# 2. Send the project to the GitHub repository (if haven‚Äôt already):
# - Push the e-commerce project to a GitHub repository to facilitate version control and collaboration.

# 3. Implement a Continuous Integration (CI) flow of build and test in GitHub Actions:
# - Create a main.yml file within the .github/workflows directory to define the CI workflow.
# - Configure the workflow to automatically trigger code pushes to the main branch.
# - Ensure that the workflow fails if any tests fail, preventing the deployment of faulty code.

# 4. Use GitHub Actions to build the project and run unit tests using unittest.

# 5. Deploy a PostgreSQL database on Render and link it with the Flask API:
# - Set up a PostgreSQL database service on Render to host the application's database.
# - Modify the Flask API code to use the psycopg2 library to connect to the Render-hosted PostgreSQL database.
# - Configure the database connection settings in the Flask API to establish a successful connection.

# 6. Implement a Continuous Deployment (CD) flow in GitHub Actions with deployment to Render:
# - Extend the existing GitHub Actions workflow to include a deployment stage.
# - Define deployment jobs to deploy the application to Render.
# - Ensure that the deployment only occurs after the CI tests have passed successfully.

# 7. Validate the API's functionality through Swagger-generated documentation:
# - Integrate the Swagger documentation into the Flask API to provide a comprehensive overview of the API's endpoints and functionality.
# - Ensure that the Swagger documentation is up-to-date and reflects the current state of the API.
# - Use the Swagger UI to interact with the API and verify its functionality, including testing various endpoints and verifying responses.

# 8. GitHub Repository:
# - Maintain a clean and interactive README.md file in the GitHub repository, providing clear instructions on how to run the application and explanations of its features.
# - Include a link to the GitHub repository in the project documentation.

# Project Tips

# 1. Database Connection Configuration:
# - Install the psycopg2-binary and psycopg2 libraries within the requirements.txt file to establish a PostgreSQL database connection.
# - Ensure that libpq-dev is installed to resolve any potential dependency issues.

# 2. Pipeline Configuration:
# - Utilize multiple jobs within the GitHub Actions workflow to achieve a better understanding of the CI/CD process.
# - Create a .github/workflows directory and a main.yaml file to define the CI/CD workflow.

# 3. Integration Continuous Testing:
# - Implement unit tests for the Flask API using the unittest libraries.
# - Ensure that the CI workflow includes a test step that runs these unit tests to validate the functionality of the blog project.

# 4. Deploy Databases in Render:
# - Leverage Render's built-in PostgreSQL database service to host the application's database.
# - Configure the database connection settings in the Flask API to connect to the Render-hosted PostgreSQL database.

# 5. Install Gunicorn for Production Deployment
# - Install the gunicorn library within the requirements.txt file to facilitate the deployment of the Flask API to Render.
